  To learn more about the data analysis process.
  To learn how to use Python to conduct the various types of Analysis.
  To learn how to use Python to complete webscraping.

This image inspires me to embrace the unknown during the class and although it can be frigtening, I believe that there are 
many opportunities to learn and grow. Also, I do feel like I'm lost but I hope to find my way throughout this class so that I can
apply what I learn at work.
